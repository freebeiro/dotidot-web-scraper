# Unplanned Task Process - Dotidot Web Scraper

## üéØ Purpose

This document defines how to handle unplanned tasks, changes, or improvements that arise during development. Every change must be traceable and follow the same quality standards as planned work.

## üìã Process for Unplanned Tasks

### **Step 1: Document the Task**

When a new unplanned task is identified:

1. **Create a task entry** in progress.md under a new section:
   ```markdown
   ## üîß Unplanned Tasks Log

   ### Task U1: [Task Description]
   **Requested**: [Date/Time]
   **Reason**: [Why this task is needed]
   **Status**: Pending
   **Impact**: [Does this affect current step? Yes/No]
   ```

2. **Add to TodoWrite** with prefix "UNPLANNED:"
   ```
   id: "unplanned-1"
   content: "UNPLANNED: [Task description]"
   status: "pending"
   priority: "medium"
   ```

### **Step 2: Follow EXACT Same Workflow as Planned Tasks**

Unplanned tasks MUST follow the **IDENTICAL workflow** as planned tasks:

#### **üìã Step A: Live Rule Filtering (MANDATORY)**
```markdown
## Live Rule Filtering for TASK_XXX

### Scanning rule files...
- Checking testing_strategy_rules.md...
  - ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Run full test suite before marking complete"
  - ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Fix failing tests incrementally"
- Checking code_quality_rules.md...
  - ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "All code must pass RuboCop"
```

**Document the actual rules you're following!**

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Step B: Implementation Plan**
- Create implementation checklist BEFORE starting
- Break down into subtasks
- Follow filtered rules strictly

#### **üß™ Step C: Testing & Validation**
- Run all tests as per testing rules
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Document all test commands and results

#### **üìù Step D: Documentation & Commit**
- Create proper documentation file
- Update task log
- Commit with standard format
- Update progress tracking

### **Step 3: Update Progress Tracking**

After completing the unplanned task:

1. **Update task entry** in progress.md:
   ```markdown
   ### Task U1: [Task Description]
   **Requested**: [Date/Time]
   **Completed**: [Date/Time]
   **Reason**: [Why this task is needed]
   **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
   **Impact**: [Did this affect current step?]
   **Commit**: [commit hash or message]
   **Changes**: [Brief summary of what was done]
   ```

2. **Update TodoWrite** to mark complete

3. **Resume planned work** from where it was paused

## üìä Examples of Unplanned Tasks

### **Infrastructure Changes**
- Reorganizing directory structure
- Updating documentation processes
- Fixing git issues
- Environment configuration

### **Process Improvements**
- Adding new procedures
- Clarifying existing processes
- Improving development workflow

### **Bug Fixes**
- Fixing broken tests
- Resolving dependency issues
- Correcting configuration errors

### **Rollbacks**
- Reverting problematic changes
- Undoing commits
- Restoring previous state

## üîÑ Rollback Process

If an unplanned task needs to be rolled back:

1. **Document the rollback**:
   ```markdown
   ### Rollback R1: [What is being rolled back]
   **Original Task**: U1
   **Reason for Rollback**: [Why rollback is needed]
   **Status**: In Progress
   ```

2. **Perform the rollback**:
   - Use `git revert` for clean history
   - Or `git reset` if not yet pushed
   - Document the approach used

3. **Update tracking**:
   - Mark original task as "Rolled Back"
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update any affected documentation

## üìù Integration with Existing Process

### **During Step Implementation**
If unplanned task arises DURING a step:
1. Pause current step
2. Document current progress
3. Handle unplanned task
4. Resume step implementation

### **Between Steps**
If unplanned task arises BETWEEN steps:
1. Complete current step first (if possible)
2. Handle unplanned task
3. Continue to next planned step

## ‚úÖ Benefits of This Process

1. **Full Traceability**: Every change is documented
2. **Consistent Quality**: All work follows same standards
3. **Clear Timeline**: Shows when/why changes happened
4. **Easy Handoff**: Other AIs can see full history
5. **Learning Record**: Documents decisions and rationale

## üìñ Example: How TASK_003 Should Have Been Handled

### Step 1: Document the Task
```markdown
### Task U3: Debug and Fix 156+ Failing Specs
**Requested**: 2025-05-29 14:00
**Reason**: Blocking Task #1 verification
**Status**: Pending
**Impact**: Yes - blocks Task #1 completion
```

### Step 2A: Live Rule Filtering
```markdown
## Live Rule Filtering for TASK_003

### Scanning testing_strategy_rules.md...
- ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Fix failing tests incrementally, one file at a time"
- ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Never modify test expectations without understanding why they're failing"
- ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Run focused specs first: bundle exec rspec spec/file_spec.rb"

### Scanning code_quality_rules.md...
- ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Extract complex methods when exceeding RuboCop limits"
- ‚úÖ CHERRY-PICKED: "Use service objects for business logic"
```

### Step 2B: Implementation Plan
- [ ] Identify root cause of failures
- [ ] Fix service API inconsistencies
- [ ] Update specs to match implementation
- [ ] Run RuboCop and fix violations
- [ ] Verify all tests pass

### Step 2C: Testing & Validation
```bash
bundle exec rspec --fail-fast  # Find first failure
bundle exec rspec spec/services/  # Fix service specs first
bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect  # Fix style issues
bundle exec rspec  # Full suite
```

### Step 2D: Documentation
- Created procedures/unplanned_tasks/TASK_003_DEBUG_FIX_SPECS.md
- Updated task log
- Committed with proper message

## üö® Important Notes

- **Never skip documentation** for "quick fixes"
- **Always follow the EXACT workflow** as planned tasks
- **Live rule filtering is MANDATORY** - not optional
- **Create implementation plan BEFORE coding**
- **Update progress.md** for every unplanned task
- **Use descriptive commit messages** that reference the task
- **Consider impact** on current/future planned work

**Remember**: Unplanned tasks are part of real development. Handling them professionally with full documentation makes the project stronger and more maintainable.
