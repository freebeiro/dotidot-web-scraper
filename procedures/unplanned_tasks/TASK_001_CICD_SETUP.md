# Unplanned Task: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

## Task Identifier
- **ID**: TASK_001
- **Date**: 2025-01-30
- **Phase**: Post-Phase 1
- **Type**: Infrastructure Enhancement

## Context
After merging Phase 1 PR, user identified that we lacked CI/CD automation for ensuring code quality and test execution.

## Problem Statement
No automated checks were running on pull requests, meaning:
- Tests could be broken without immediate visibility
- Code quality issues could slip through
- Security vulnerabilities might go unnoticed
- Manual verification was required for every change

## Solution Implemented
Created comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with:

### 1. Main CI Workflow
- Automated test execution with PostgreSQL service
- RuboCop linting checks
- Docker image build verification
- Code coverage reporting

### 2. Security Scanning Workflow
- Brakeman security scanner for Rails vulnerabilities
- Bundler audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- OWASP dependency check
- Weekly scheduled scans

### 3. Code Quality Workflow
- RuboCop with GitHub PR annotations via reviewdog
- RubyCritic for code complexity analysis
- Reek for code smell detection
- Coverage threshold enforcement

### 4. Supporting Infrastructure
- SimpleCov integration for coverage reporting
- PR template for consistent descriptions
- Dependabot configuration for dependency updates

## Files Created/Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `Gemfile` (added SimpleCov gems)
- `spec/spec_helper.rb` (SimpleCov configuration)

## Impact on Project
- **Positive**: Automated quality gates ensure consistent code standards
- **Positive**: Early detection of security issues
- **Positive**: Reduced manual review burden
- **Consideration**: May slow down PR merges if checks fail
- **Consideration**: Additional maintenance of CI/CD configuration

## Lessons Learned
- CI/CD should be set up early in project lifecycle
- Consider adding to initial project bootstrap checklist
- GitHub Actions provide comprehensive Rails testing capabilities

## Follow-up Actions
- Monitor CI/CD execution times and optimize if needed
- Add deployment workflows when production environment is ready
- Consider adding performance benchmarking to CI pipeline
