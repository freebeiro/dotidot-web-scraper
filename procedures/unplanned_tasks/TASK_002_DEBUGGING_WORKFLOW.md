# Unplanned Task: Debugging Workflow Procedure

## Task Identifier
- **ID**: TASK_002
- **Date**: 2025-01-30
- **Phase**: Post-Error Handling Implementation
- **Type**: Process Enhancement (DEBUGGING_TASK)

## Context
After encountering recurring issues with `bundle exec rubocop -A && bundle exec rspec` failures during error handling implementation, user identified the need for a systematic debugging workflow that would work across different AI/LLM sessions.

## Problem Statement
No structured debugging process existed, leading to:
- Experimental fixes being made directly on feature branches
- Risk of breaking other functionality during debugging
- Lack of systematic approach to isolate and fix issues
- Inconsistent debugging practices across different AI sessions
- Need to experiment safely without affecting main development flow

## Solution Implemented
Created comprehensive debugging workflow procedure with cross-AI session compatibility:

### 1. DEBUGGING_TASK Definition
- New task type specifically for handling errors and test failures
- Mandatory triggers for recurring errors or failed tests
- Required creation of debug branches from feature branches

### 2. Debug Branch Workflow
- **MANDATORY**: Always create debug branch from feature branch (not main)
- Naming convention: `debug/fix-specific-issue`
- Safe experimentation space without affecting feature branch
- Apply only clean solutions back to feature branch

### 3. Cross-AI Session Compatibility
- Comprehensive documentation for future AI assistants
- Clear procedures that work regardless of which AI/LLM is working
- Self-contained instructions for debugging workflow
- Integration with existing git workflow rules

### 4. Mandatory Triggers
- `bundle exec rubocop -A && bundle exec rspec` failures
- Recurring test failures (same test fails multiple times)
- Error handling issues requiring systematic debugging

## Files Created/Modified
- `procedures/DEBUGGING_WORKFLOW.md` (created)
- `rules/git_workflow_rules.md` (updated with debug branch patterns)
- `procedures/NEW_PROJECT_BOOTSTRAP.md` (updated to include debugging workflow as mandatory procedure)

## Impact on Project
- **Positive**: Systematic approach to debugging prevents breaking other functionality
- **Positive**: Cross-AI session compatibility ensures consistent debugging practices
- **Positive**: Safe experimentation space through debug branches
- **Positive**: Clear triggers for when to enter debugging mode
- **Consideration**: Requires discipline to follow debug branch workflow
- **Consideration**: Additional git branch management overhead

## Lessons Learned
- Debugging should be treated as a special task type requiring specific workflow
- Experimental fixes should never be made directly on feature branches
- Cross-AI session compatibility requires detailed documentation
- Debug branches provide safe space for experimentation
- Systematic triggers help identify when debugging workflow is needed

## Follow-up Actions
- Test the debugging workflow procedure with actual debugging scenarios
- Monitor effectiveness of debug branch workflow
- Consider adding debugging workflow to other projects
- Refine procedure based on real-world usage experience
