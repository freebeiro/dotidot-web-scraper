# Progress Tracking - Dotidot Web Scraper

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup COMPLETE âœ…  
**Current Step**: Ready for Phase 2 - Core API Implementation  
**Overall Progress**: 19.0% (8 of 42 steps completed)

## âœ… Phase 1 Complete - Foundation Setup

### **Step 8: Foundation Integration Testing (âœ… COMPLETED):**
- [x] Integration spec created testing full service chain
- [x] Tests URL validation â†’ HTTP fetch â†’ HTML parse â†’ CSS extract workflow
- [x] Error propagation verified across service boundaries
- [x] Malformed HTML and invalid selector handling tested
- [x] Document reuse for multiple extractions verified
- [x] All automated tests pass (96 examples, 0 failures)
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] Clean Git commits created

### **Step 7: CSS Extraction Strategy (âœ… COMPLETED):**
- [x] CssExtractionStrategy created with field extraction logic
- [x] Support for multiple field formats (hash, string array)
- [x] Text normalization and whitespace handling
- [x] Partial failure handling (continues extracting other fields)
- [x] Security validation against malicious selectors
- [x] ExtractedField struct with success/error tracking
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage

### **Step 6: HTML Parser Service (âœ… COMPLETED):**
- [x] HtmlParserService created with Nokogiri wrapper
- [x] Parse once, query multiple times pattern
- [x] Handles encoding issues and malformed HTML gracefully
- [x] Size validation and parser options configured
- [x] UTF-8 encoding normalization
- [x] Comprehensive error handling

### **Step 5: HTTP Client Service (âœ… COMPLETED):**
- [x] HttpClientService created with http.rb gem
- [x] Configurable timeouts and retry logic
- [x] Exponential backoff retry strategy
- [x] User-Agent configuration
- [x] Redirect following support
- [x] WebMock integration for testing

### **Step 4: URL Validation Service (âœ… COMPLETED):**
- [x] UrlValidatorService created with SSRF protection
- [x] Private IP range blocking (RFC 1918, RFC 3927, etc.)
- [x] Hostname validation and blocklist
- [x] URL scheme validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)
- [x] Length limits and format validation
- [x] Comprehensive security testing

### **Step 3: Custom Error Hierarchy (âœ… COMPLETED):**
- [x] ScraperErrors module created
- [x] BaseError, ValidationError, SecurityError, NetworkError classes
- [x] Structured error handling throughout application
- [x] Test coverage for inheritance and instantiation

## ðŸš€ Ready for Phase 2

**Immediate Next Step:** Create PR for Phase 1 (Foundation Setup)

### Phase 1 Deliverables Summary:
- âœ… Custom error hierarchy with specialized exceptions
- âœ… SSRF-protected URL validation service
- âœ… HTTP client with exponential backoff retry logic
- âœ… Nokogiri HTML parser with encoding recovery
- âœ… CSS selector extraction with text normalization
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (96 examples, 0 failures)
- âœ… RuboCop integration for code quality enforcement
- âœ… Clean git history ready for review

### Technology Stack Verified:
- Ruby 3.2.6 with Rails 7.1 API mode
- Nokogiri for HTML/XML parsing
- HTTP.rb for network requests
- RSpec + WebMock for testing
- RuboCop for code quality

**Next Phase:** Core API Implementation (Steps 9-14)
- Step 9: Database models and migrations
- Step 10: API endpoints for scraping operations
- Step 11: Request/response serialization
- Step 12: Authentication and rate limiting
- Step 13: Background job processing
- Step 14: API documentation and validation
