# Active Context - Dotidot Web Scraper

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus

**Active Phase**: Phase 3 - Performance & Caching  
**Current Step**: Step 19 - Performance Monitoring  
**Priority**: Add performance monitoring and request tracking

## ðŸ“‹ Performance Monitoring - Focused Rules

### ðŸŽ¯ RELEVANT RULES (5 Total)

1. **Performance Monitoring Setup (Performance Rule #5)**
   - Track response times for all endpoints
   - Monitor cache hit rates and performance
   - Track background job performance (if applicable)
   - Monitor memory and CPU usage
   - Set up performance alerts and logging

2. **Logging Patterns (Code Quality Rule #6)**
   - Implement structured logging for performance metrics
   - Log performance data with proper formatting
   - Include request IDs for tracing
   - Use appropriate log levels
   - Create performance-specific logger

3. **Middleware Configuration (Performance Rule #6)**
   - Create performance tracking middleware
   - Ensure minimal performance overhead
   - Track key metrics without impacting response time
   - Configure proper sampling for high-traffic scenarios

4. **Testing Strategy (Testing Rule #7)**
   - Test performance monitoring functionality
   - Verify metrics collection works correctly
   - Test performance under different load conditions
   - Mock performance scenarios for testing

5. **Git Workflow (Git Rule #1)**
   - Create feature branch: `feature/performance-monitoring`
   - Commit format: `feat: add performance monitoring and request tracking`
   - Test both automated and manual verification

### ðŸš« IGNORED RULES (Not Relevant for Performance Monitoring)

- **Web Scraping Rules** - Not modifying scraping logic
- **Database Performance** - Performance monitoring is application-level
- **Security Patterns** - Not handling user input, just monitoring
- **API Design Rules** - Not changing API endpoints, just adding monitoring
- **Background Processing** - Focused on request-level monitoring

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Context

### **What We're Building Right Now:**
- Performance monitoring middleware/service
- Request timing and response time tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Cache performance metrics
- Structured logging for performance data

### **Success Criteria for Current Step:**
- [ ] Performance tracking middleware implemented
- [ ] Response time logging for all API requests
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring capability
- [ ] Cache hit/miss rate tracking
- [ ] Request ID tracking for correlation
- [ ] Performance dashboard data structure

### **Testing Requirements:**
- **Automated**: RSpec tests for performance monitoring functionality
- **Manual**: Rails console testing to verify metrics collection

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Project Status

### **Recently Completed:**
âœ… **Step 18: Rate Limiting Setup** - Just completed with rack-attack
- Per-IP throttling (20 requests/minute)
- Per-domain throttling (10 requests/minute)
- Global throttling (100 requests/minute)
- Security blocking for malicious URLs
- Comprehensive test suite and monitoring

### **Phase 3 Progress:**
- **Step 15**: Redis Configuration âœ… (Completed with caching)
- **Step 16**: Page Cache Service âœ… (Completed with CacheService)
- **Step 17**: Cache Integration âœ… (Completed with ScraperOrchestratorService)
- **Step 18**: Rate Limiting Setup âœ… (Just completed)
- **Step 19**: Performance Monitoring ðŸš€ (Current step)

## ðŸ§  Architecture Context

### **Current System Capabilities:**
- **Foundation**: Complete service-oriented architecture
- **API**: GET/POST /data endpoints with full functionality
- **Security**: URL validation, SSRF protection, rate limiting
- **Performance**: Redis caching with 1-hour TTL
- **Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage, clean code

### **Technology Stack Verified:**
- Rails 7.1 API mode with PostgreSQL
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- Nokogiri for HTML parsing
- HTTP.rb for network requests
- RSpec + WebMock for testing
- Rack::Attack for rate limiting

## âš¡ Next Actions

### **Immediate Task (Step 19):**
1. **Live Rule Filtering** - Identify relevant rules for performance monitoring
2. **Performance Middleware** - Create middleware for request tracking
3. **Metrics Collection** - Implement response time and memory tracking
4. **Structured Logging** - Add performance logging with proper format
5. **RSpec Tests** - Test performance monitoring functionality
6. **Manual Testing** - Verify metrics collection in Rails console
7. **Commit** - `feat: add performance monitoring and request tracking`

### **Following Steps (Phase 3):**
- **Step 20**: Background Processing Setup (if needed)
- Move to Phase 4: Quality & Documentation

## ðŸ“Š Progress Overview

### **Current Status:**
- **Overall Progress**: 30.9% (13 of 42 steps completed)
- **Phase 3**: 80% complete (4 of 5 steps done)
- **All Tests**: âœ… Passing
- **Code Quality**: âœ… RuboCop clean

### **Major Milestones Achieved:**
âœ… Complete Dotidot challenge requirements (Tasks 1-3)  
âœ… Enterprise-level security with SSRF protection  
âœ… Performance optimization with Redis caching  
âœ… API rate limiting with comprehensive protection  
ðŸš€ Ready for performance monitoring implementation
