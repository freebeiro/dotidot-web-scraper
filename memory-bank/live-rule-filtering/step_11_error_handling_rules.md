# Step 11: Robust Error Handling - Filtered Rules Checklist

## Enhancements to Implement

### 1. Request Context & Tracing
- [x] Add request_id to all responses for tracing
- [x] Include request_id in all log entries
- [x] Add correlation ID support for distributed tracing

### 2. Structured Logging
- [x] Create centralized logging concern
- [x] Log with structured format (JSON in production)
- [x] Include context: request_id, user_agent, url, duration
- [x] Different log levels for different environments

### 3. Enhanced Error Classes
- [x] Add error codes to all custom errors
- [x] Add retry_after for rate limit errors
- [x] Add suggested_action for user guidance
- [x] Include debug context in development

### 4. Error Response Enrichment
- [x] Consistent error response format
- [x] Include help_url for error documentation
- [x] Add error_id for support reference
- [x] Include timestamp and request_id

### 5. Service-Level Improvements
- [x] Add timeout errors with specific messages
- [x] Implement circuit breaker pattern (basic)
- [x] Add retry information in errors
- [x] Log all external service calls

### 6. Controller Enhancements
- [x] Centralize error handling in concern
- [x] Add before_action for request setup
- [x] Implement after_action for response logging
- [x] Handle all possible error types

### 7. Monitoring Hooks
- [x] Add error notification callbacks
- [x] Implement performance tracking
- [x] Add custom error tags for filtering
- [x] Support for external monitoring services

## Implementation Order

1. Create ErrorHandling concern for controllers
2. Create RequestLogging concern
3. Enhance error classes with additional context
4. Update controller to use new concerns
5. Add structured logging to services
6. Create comprehensive error handling tests
